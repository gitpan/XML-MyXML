        Added the 'soft' flag to &tidy_xml

0.0951  Mar 6th, 2007
        Corrected bug where ->value would double-decode

0.095   Mar 6th, 2007
        Added support for parsing the simplest and non-recursive form of <!ENTITY> markup

0.094   Mar 6th, 2007
        Added a space before the '?>' mark in the XML declaration introduced in 0.093
        Corrected small bits in documentation

0.093   Mar 5th, 2007
        Parser will now ignore all special markup instead of dying on it (except for CDATA sections which it can handle since v0.061)
        XML documents produced with this module may now have an XML declaration in the beginning (<?xml ... ?>)
		Almost all functions and methods accept flags now
        Wrote features & limitations in the documentation
        Wrote a 'function flags' section in the documentation

        check_xml, which used to be able to check XML strings only, can now check XML files also
        Added an optional 'soft' mode to xml_to_simple and xml_to_object functions, which returns undef instead of dying in case of error
        Added the :all export tag - imports all exportable functions

0.091   Mar 4th, 2007
        xml_to_simple and xml_to_object can now accept a filename for an argument
        Minor alterations in the documentation

0.09    Mar 3rd, 2007
        simple_to_xml($simple_ref) has been changed to allow the argument to be a hashref, an arrayref or a mixed structure

0.083   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Changed the way that flags are set. Instead of a string such as 'strip internal', it's with a hashref { strip => 1, internal => 1 }. Module stops execution and informs about the change, if programmer tries to set flags with the old way.

0.082   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Added optional 'strip' mode for the &xml_to_simple function and the $obj->simplify method, that strips surrounding whitespace from texts

0.081   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Added an 'internal' mode for the &xml_to_simple function
        Added a 'strip' mode for the ->value method that strips surrounding whitespace

0.08    Mar 1st, 2007
        XML-decodes the attribute values when parsing documents, and XML-encodes them when creating XML documents
        Added the ->tag method to XML objects, which retrieves the tag name of the top element
        Minor changes in the documentation

0.076   Feb 27th, 2007
        $element->value returns empty string ('') if element is empty, instead of null

0.075   Feb 25th, 2007
        Added the ->attr('attr_name') method to XML objects, which retrieves the value of an attribute

        Added a check_xml function that checks if the provided XML document is valid enough for use with this module

        Allows whitespace and comments to exist before the root element
