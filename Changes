Revision history for XML-MyXML

0.09921 2013-08-12
        Re-releasing because of a mistake I made in the release process previously

0.0992  2013-08-12
        Prepared this module for KJabberd. More specifically:
        simple_to_xml now returns empty elements correctly (<el/>)
        $obj->tag now optionally doesn't strip the namespace
        paths may contain attrs, like in CSS3 selectors
        added $el->cmp_element('tag[attr=val]') method (returns 1 or 0)
        allow setting of attributes

0.0991  2013-04-07
        Test some file reading/writing functions of the module as well

0.0990  2013-03-28
        Use ':encoding(UTF-8)' instead of ':utf8' with binmode
        Include $! in error messages when open fails
        Remove the '&' symbol from function calls
        Include all of the dependencies (including Perl version) in the META files

0.0989  2013-03-23
        Wrote basic tests
        Use the 3-param syntax for 'open' (for read & write)

0.0988  2013-03-21
        Switched from using filehandle globs (like FILE) to ordinary scalars (like $fh)

0.0987  2013-03-11
        Switched to Dist::Zilla

0.0986  Oct 8th, 2007
        Added the ->parent() method

0.09851 Sep 7th, 2007
        Deleted a duplicate sentence from the documentation

0.0985  Sep 5th, 2007
        If $obj->attr is called without parameters, will return a hash of all attribute => value pairs

0.098061 Aug 10th, 2007
        Minor modification in the documentation to describe change in version 0.09806

0.09806 Aug 10th, 2007
        XML documents to be parsed may be encoded either in UTF-8 or in some other encoding provided this encoding is declared in the XML declaration ( <?xml ... encoding="..." ?> ) in the beginning of the document

0.09805 Jul 27th, 2007
        Slight improvements to the $obj->delete method and to garbage-colection throughout the module

0.098   Jul 26th, 2007
        Added the $obj->delete method that will clear the memory of an object (needed because an object and its children refer to each other circularly)

0.09766 Apr 17th, 2007
        All functions that parse XML strings will convert string to utf8 if a different encoding is declared in the XML declaration

0.09765 Apr 17th, 2007
        Fixed dependencies so tests don't fail

0.09762 Apr 16th, 2007
        Some functions now check whether the provided XML is valid utf-8, and produce an error if it's not (having 'soft' flag turned on will return undef in case of invalid utf-8)

0.09761 Apr 16th, 2007
        Removed some debugging code

0.0976  Apr 16th, 2007

0.0975  Apr 16th, 2007
        Fixed encoding issue

0.0974  Apr 16th, 2007
        Fixed encoding issue

0.0973  Apr 15th, 2007

0.097   Mar 24th, 2007
        &simple_to_xml can add xslt declarations in the beginning
        &xml_to_simple and ->simplify can create arrayrefs in addition to hashrefs (arrayrefs preserve order and duplicate elements)
        Fixed bug where &xml_to_object would choke with some symbols in utf8::upgrade'd XML strings

0.0969  Mar 17th, 2007
        Fixed bug where simple_to_xml wouldn't accept attributes at the root element
        Fixed XML version in declaration from 1.1 to 1.0

0.0968  Mar 9th, 2007

        Corrected bug where the indentstring flag on &simple_to_xml wouldn't do anything

0.096   Mar 6th, 2007
        Added ability for the following functions/methods to save their XML output to a file: &tidy_xml, &object_to_xml, &simple_to_xml, ->to_xml, ->to_tidy_xml
        Added the 'soft' flag to &tidy_xml

0.0951  Mar 6th, 2007

        Added a space before the '?>' mark in the XML declaration introduced in 0.093
        Corrected small bits in documentation

0.093   Mar 5th, 2007
        Parser will now ignore all special markup instead of dying on it (except for CDATA sections which it can handle since v0.061)
        XML documents produced with this module may now have an XML declaration in the beginning (<?xml ... ?>)
        Almost all functions and methods accept flags now
        Wrote features & limitations in the documentation
        Wrote a 'function flags' section in the documentation

0.092   Mar 5th, 2007
        check_xml, which used to be able to check XML strings only, can now check XML files also
        Added an optional 'soft' mode to xml_to_simple and xml_to_object functions, which returns undef instead of dying in case of error
        Added the :all export tag - imports all exportable functions

0.091   Mar 4th, 2007
        xml_to_simple and xml_to_object can now accept a filename for an argument

        simple_to_xml($simple_ref) has been changed to allow the argument to be a hashref, an arrayref or a mixed structure

0.083   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Changed the way that flags are set. Instead of a string such as 'strip internal', it's with a hashref { strip => 1, internal => 1 }. Module stops execution and informs about the change, if programmer tries to set flags with the old way.

0.082   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Added optional 'strip' mode for the &xml_to_simple function and the $obj->simplify method, that strips surrounding whitespace from texts

0.081   Mar 3rd, 2007
        Added an 'internal' mode for the &xml_to_simple function
        Added a 'strip' mode for the ->value method that strips surrounding whitespace

0.066   Feb 25th, 2007
        Allows whitespace and comments to exist before the root element
